This project is based on above mentioned work of original authors, I'm trying to implement the concepts of Machine Learning and Deep Learning as mentioned in the paper.

* Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral.
* A simple sentiment analysis can be done using python <a href="https://realpython.com/sentiment-analysis-python/">here</a>
* This project is not about doing a simple sentiment analysis on a given data.
* Instead, the approach is to use a voting based classification system and compare the relative performance of polarity based method vs different combinations of Machine Learning Classifier and Deep Learning Models.
